Blood Pressure Readings
If possible, an array or DataFrame with Dates and BP measurements is great. Would prefer a separate integer value for Systolic and Diastolic (versus a string "130/80")

List of Patient's current medications
I will parse through in my logic for the antihypertensives
If we can make sure they're all in similar format though, that would help. (Ie, all text, or all codes, or all lowercase, etc.)



Non-pharmacological interventions (probably limited in CCD): BMI, alcohol use, smoking, exercise, diet


Table 8.1.2

Fig 4
if atBPGoal and onMed: ##
	Reassess in 3-6mo

if BP <120/80 #Normal BP ##
	Promote optimal lifestyle habits
	reassess in 1y
if SBP 120-129 and DBP < 80 #Elevated BP ##
	NonPharm Therapy,
	Reassess in 3-6 mo
if SBP 130-139 and DBP 80-89 #Stage 1 Htn ##
	if ASCVD < 10%
		Nonpharm therapy
		Reassess in 3-6 mo
	else
		Nonpharm and BP Lowering Med
		Reassess in 1 mo
if BP > 140 or DBP > 90 #Stage 2 Htn ##
	Nonpharm + BP Lowering Med (2x of diff classes)
	Reassess in 1 mo

if SBP > 180 or DBP > 110  ??? Chose to leave out
	Prompt AntiHTN drug treatment

if Clinical CVD and SBP>130 or DBP>80 ##
	Some BP Lowering Meds

#Setting BP Goals 
if Dx of HTN and (hxOfCVD or ASCVD > 10%) ##
	set BP target to 130/80

#Choice Initial Med ##
if choosingInitialMed for Stage 1 HTN
	Rec Thiazide, CCB, ACEi/ARB #The first line
	Follow up in 1 month

if choosingInitialMed for Stage 2 HTN or BP more than 20/10 over BP target ##
	Rec 2 first line agents (Thiazide, CCB, ACEi/ARB)
	Follow-up in 1 month

#Patients with Stable Ischemic Heart Disease (Stable Angina)
If SIHD and HTN ##
	BP Goal 130/80

If (Previous MI or SIHD) and HTN with BP > 130/80 ##
	Should be on GDMT Bblocker/ACE/ARB first
		if Angina?
			Add CCBs if needed
		else:
			then add CCBs/Thiazides/MRAs as needed

#HF ##
if risk of HF
	bp goal 130/80
if HFrEF and HTN
	GDMT and BP goal 130/80
if HFpEF and HTN
	use Diuretics to control HTN and volume overload
if HFpEF and HTN and already on diuretics
	Rec ACEi/ARB and Bblocker titrated to 130

#CKD
if HTN and CKD ##
	BP Goal 130/80

if HTN and CKD (Stage 3+ OR Stage1/2 w/ Albuminuria >300mg/d, or >300  AlbtoCreat ratio or an equivalent in the first morning void) ##
	tx with an ACEi to slow kidney dz progression

#Prior hx of TIA or Stroke ##
If hx of stroke/tia and SBP > 140 or DBP > 90 and no current Antihtn drug
	Initiate antihypertensive Tx, to reduce risk of recurrent stroke and other vascular events
	Potentially recommend BP Goal 130/80

#Diabetes ##
If DM and HTN
	Set Goal 130/80
	All first line agents are useful and effective
	Class IIb recommendation to consider ACEi/ARB first in setting of albuminuria

#Race and Eth ##
If Black + HTN + (Not HF or CKD)
	Initial drug should include thiazide or CCB
	if already has drug, confirm thiazide/CCB
	If goal is 130/80, rec 2 drugs

#Pregnancy
If pregnant or becoming pregnant,
	transition to methyldopa, nifedipine, and/or labetalol

#Over 65, community-dwelling, noninstitutionalized ##
	Set SBP goal 130

#Resistant HTN
If SBP/DBP >130/80 AND (3+ meds at optimal dose, including a diuretic if possible) OR (BP <130 but on 4+ meds)
	Ensure office measurements, assess for nonadherence, obtain home readings to exclude white coat effect
	Lifestyle Contributors:
		Obesity, Physical inactivity, Excess alcohol, High salt, low-fiber diet
	Interfering Substances
		NSAIDs, Sympathomimetics (amph, decongest), Stimulants, OCPs, Licorice, Ephedra
	Screen Secondary Causes
		Primary Aldosteronism (Elevated Aldosterone/renin ratio)
		CKD (eGFR < 60)
		Renal Artery Stenosis
		Pheochromocytoma
		OSA
	Pharm Tx:
		Maximize diuretics
		Add MRA
		Add other agents with diff mechanisms
		Use Loops diuretics in those with CKD
		Use loops in those with Potent Vasodilators on board
	If uncontrolled for 6 months
		Refer to specialist for HTN or known secondary cause
